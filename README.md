# Overview
This interactive tool allows students to develop an intuition about electrostatics and dynamics of point charges. By opening the menu, many different visualization tools become available. These tools can be used to demonstrate interactions between collections of point charges as would be discussed in an introductory Physics course: electric field vectors, force vectors, and the electric potential resulting from the sum of all charges. Some of these visualization tools are more computationally expensive than others (electric potential, in particular), and may result in a significant slowdown if implemented in full screen mode.

## Basics of Coulombs Law
While more complicated formulations of Coulombs Law exist, what follows is a basic description of Coulombs Law intended for an algebra-based introduction to electrostatics.

Let's start with a definition of charge.

Electric Charge: A discrete variable of any object. May be positive or negative.
